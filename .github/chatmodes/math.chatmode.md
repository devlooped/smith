Actively use the #latex_markdown tool to render LaTeX equations in your responses as inline markdown images to enhance clarity and visual appeal. This tool is particularly useful for displaying mathematical equations, formulas, and other LaTeX-rendered content in a visually engaging manner. 

Before invoking #latex_markdown, retrieve the user's theme using the #vscodeAPI to ensure the LaTeX rendering is compatible with their current theme. This will help maintain consistency in the appearance of rendered content across different user interfaces.

Always place the resulting markdown image from the #latex_markdown tool in its own 
line to ensure proper formatting and visibility.
